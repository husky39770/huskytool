huskytool, a multitool made in Batch.

Installation instructions:
1) Go to releases and download a release (preferrably the latest one)
2) Extract the .zip file
3) Open the folder that was in the .zip file
4) Execute the .bat file

huskytool is a free product, this does not mean that you can reupload it, making a custom version is fine but don't ever upload it (personal use only).
