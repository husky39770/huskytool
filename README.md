huskytool, a multitool made in batch

installation instructions:
1) download the repository as a .zip file
2) extract the .zip file
3) navigate to the version you want to use

huskytool is a free product, this does not mean that you can reupload it, making a custom version is fine but don't ever upload it (personal use only)
